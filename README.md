# Handwritten-Text-Recognition
This project implements a deep learning-based handwritten text recognition system using TensorFlow. The model is trained on a dataset of over 10,000 handwritten sentences, utilizing state-of-the-art techniques for optimal recognition accuracy. It focuses on preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating the performance to provide reliable text recognition results.

# Key Features
- Preprocessing: Curated dataset preparation, image augmentation, and normalization for robust model performance.
- Model Architecture: Implemented a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras with convolutional layers for feature extraction and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for sequence prediction.
- Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including accuracy, loss, and prediction visualization, to assess model performance.
- Real-world Applications: Can be extended to digitize handwritten documents, forms, and notes efficiently.
